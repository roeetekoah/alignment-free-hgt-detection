END-TO-END ANALYSIS PIPELINE (STUBS) for the *already-pruned undirected* cross-species protein graph.

Input format (CSV/TSV), columns:
  u, v, shared_kmers, jaccard, species_u, species_v

Example row:
  GCF_000005845.2_ASM584v2|NP_414543.1,
  GCF_000240185.1_ASM24018v2|YP_005225012.1,
  544,0.505107,Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae

Assumptions:
  - Edges are already undirected and pruned (degree explosion + per species-pair Jaccard percentile).
  - Edges are cross-species (species_u != species_v).
  - File size ~10–20MB; feasible to load fully into memory.

Outputs (recommended deliverables):
  1) edge_features.tsv
  2) protein_features.tsv
  3) component_features.tsv
  4) hgt_candidates.tsv
  5) (optional) high_z_subgraph_edges.tsv for "bridge gene" analyses

Key "additions" included:
  - Robust edge surprise (z_robust) via median + MAD per species-pair.
  - Component-level HGT signal: species entropy + high-z concentration.

Implementation notes:
  - Use networkx for graph algorithms (components, clustering coeff, betweenness).
  - For speed, compute betweenness on a reduced high-z subgraph or per-component.
